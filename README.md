This code is our submission to the 'Udacity HTML5 Game Development Contest'.

This is an HTML5 based educational astronomy game titled "Constellation-Explorer".

Check out from the repository and run index.html on any HTML5 capable browser. The game involves finding various constellations drawn on a sky-dome implemented using Canvas. Constellation positions (RA and Dec) in the sky are read from a JSON file, converted into x,y,z coordinates and then drawn on the dome. Move around using the arrow keys on the numpad. F1 and F4 display help, F2 and F3 invoke game mode, and F8 presents a list of links for further reading. Click on a star to read more about the constellation it is in.
