    <b>Constellation Explorer : Help</b><hr/>

    Constellation Explorer is an educational game written in HTML5 and Javascript! 
    <br/><br/>
    This game features a sky-dome implemented in Canvas in which the player can 
    <br/>
    navigate across a collection of constellations, and with a simple left-click 
    <br/>
    on a star, learn about important constellations in the night sky. 
    <br/>
    Pressing F3 invokes 'game-mode' in which the player must find a given  
    <br/>
    constellation in the sky - the constellation's RA and Dec are provided as a hint.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Constellation Explorer was written by Abhishek Tiwary and Joseph Belbin for 
    <br/>
    Udacity's HTML5 Game Development class.
